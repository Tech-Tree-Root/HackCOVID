				<!-- <h3>What is RALLY?</h3>
				<p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<b><u>LEARNATHON</u></b> (July 17-19)

					<br>
					<br>
					by helping you connect with new teammates, learn from industry experts, and show off your talents. For this global, online initiative, we will operate multiple schedules and provide localized support to unify the world across time differences and language barriers.

					The EUvsVirus Program is a three-in-one initiative (Hackathon + Matchathon + EIC COVID Platform) organized by the European Commission, led by the European Innovation Council with the patronage of Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, and the national hackathon organizations of Europe and the United States.
				</p>
				<h3>What is the hackathon about?</h3>
				<p>
					The RALLY Hackathon offers a common organizational and technical framework in which the participants can
					get involved online and develop prototypes and solutions for technically, politically and socially relevant
					issues in the context of the Coronavirus crisis. It aims at collectively developing innovative solutions, e.g.
					high tech, low tech, hardware and software, using biotech, digital tech, societal science and other innovation
					domains. There are five areas that have been identified as targets for these innovative solutions:
					<a href="../challenges/#health">Health & Life</a>,
					<a href="../challenges/#business">Business Continuity</a>,
					<a href="../challenges/#social">Social & Political Cohesion</a>,
					<a href="../challenges/#remote">Remote Working & Education</a>,
					<a href="../challenges/#finance">Digital Finance</a>, and
					<a href="../challenges/#other">Other</a>.
					Detailed information about the topics can be found under the tab "Challenges".
				</p>
				<h3>Who owns the IP?</h3>
				<p>
					All intellectual property rights belong to the team that created and submitted the project.
				</p>
				<h3>How much English fluency is required to participate?</h3>
				<p>
					The primary language of RALLY is English, so fluency will be necessary to take full advantage. However, we will do our best to provide sufficient support in the following languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.
				</p> -->

				<h2>FAQs for Matchmakers and Account Managers</h2>
				<h3>What about the matchathon?</h3>
				<p>
					The Matchathon is an online event with two components: Demo Day on 21 May 2020 and the Matchathon itself on 22-25 May 2020. This portion of the EUvsVirus program is designed to help the hackathon winners match with corporates, investors, accelerators, venture capitalists, public authorities, elite universities, civil societies, etc. to gain mentorship, investments, and other forms of support that will help put their life-saving solutions into production to defeat coronavirus.
				</p>
				<h3>Will we get any support during the matchathon?</h3>
				<p>
					Even better, you will have support even before the matchathon. Our team has already recruited many Account Managers and Matchmakers to help you connect with corporates, investors, accelerators, venture capitalists, public authorities, elite universities, civil societies, etc. With experts and mentors coming from different knowledge backgrounds, you will receive valuable tips and feedback. More information about the organisational structure will be provided as the event approaches.
				</p>
				<h3> What will happen with the solutions after the matchathon?</h3>
				<p>
					We will invite the teams with the best solutions to join the European Innovation Council (EIC) COVID Platform to will facilitate connections with end users (e.g. hospitals) and will also provide access to investors, foundations and other funding opportunities from the EIC and other EU financial supporters. It will also be a starting point of a much longer collaboration between the European Commission and the ecosystems of innovators, makers, and start-ups across Europe related to the coronavirus crisis.
				</p>
				<h3>What is the key difference between matchmakers and account managers?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Account Managers: work closely with PARTNERS</h4>
						<p>Responsibilities are to communicate with the assigned external partners, understand their interests and willingness to support.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Matchmakers work closely with TEAMS </h4>
						<p>Responsible for his/her assigned winning teams / projects, understand their needs, in order to complete the project, provide help, support and coaching.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>When will I receive emails or assigned partner information?</h3>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, we are only able to accept a limited number of Account Managers and Matchmakers, so it is possible that you are on our wait list or were not selected. However, you are welcome to contact our Private Partnerships Team to find alternative roles and make our Matchathon a huge success story!
				</p>
				<h3>If I have been selected, when can I expect an invitation to the Slack channel?</h3>
				<p>
					All Account Managers and Matchmakers can join 
					<a href='https://euvsvirusmatchathon.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-e7u1gz9x-dy_sttGu7tH1ZF6iy7Pcmg#/' target="_blank">our Slack channel</a> and communicate with each other by clicking on this invitation: <a href='https://euvsvirusmatchathon.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-e7u1gz9x-dy_sttGu7tH1ZF6iy7Pcmg#/' target="_blank">JOIN US!</a>
				</p>
				<h3>Since the team needs will be visible in the Converve team profiles, what value can Account Managers add to the matchmaking process?</h3>
				<p>
					Account Managers should understand the interests of their assigned partners and suggest projects for possible matchmatching. Feel free to also think outside of the box! There may be projects that partners did not spot, and the human element is a key component to enhancing the matchmaking process.
				</p>
				<h3>If I recruit a new corporation, how do we onboard them?</h3>
				<p>
						First, contact the Private Partnerships Team with your suggestion and ensure that they are not already in our system. Once you receive approval, you can reach out to them with the contact template and ask them to sign up on Converve. Unfortunately, considering the constant updates to the large number of potential partners, we are not able to publish the full list.
				</p>
				<h3>How do we connect with partners and understand their needs with so little time remaining?</h3>
				<p>
						Each partner will have already completed a survey with crucial information, so you will be able to quickly understand each assignment.
				</p>
				<h3>When can I start matching partners with projects?</h3>
				<p>
						You can start as soon as you are ready!
				</p>
				<h3>When recruiting new private partners, what is the partnership model and value proposition that we can present?</h3>
				<p>
						Account Managers are expected to support and help private partners in finding as many interesting projects as possible. It is then up to the partners and projects to settle on their own agreements.
				</p>
				<h3>Can we get a timeline with all events and our roles?</h3>
				<p>
						<a href='https://www.euvsvirus.org/programme' target="_blank">Our programme (also at the top of our page)</a> lists the schedule we have put together, and you can get more updates on our Slack.
