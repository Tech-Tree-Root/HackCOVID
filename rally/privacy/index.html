				</p>
				<p>

					<br>It may be necessary by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence for us to disclose Personal Information, as well as other information as needed. We may also disclose Personal Information if we determine that doing so is necessary or appropriate for the purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.

				<p>
					<b><u>Legal Basis For The Processing of Personal Information</u></b>
					<br>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our processing of your Personal Information will

					Data such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection
					Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). If the processing of your Personal Information is necessary for the
					performance of a contract between you and us or for taking pre-contractual steps upon your request, such
					processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b). Where the processing is necessary for us to
					comply with a legal obligation, we will process your Personal Information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit.
					(c), and where the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, such processing
					will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f). Please note that where you have given your consent to the processing of your Personal Information you may withdraw your consent at any time which withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing previously made on basis of your consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><u>Transfer of Personal Information</u></b>
					<br>When we share your Personal Information with our partners and service providers, your Personal Information may be transferred to and/or made accessible from countries from around the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><u>Your Rights</u></b>
					<br>We take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, and up to date. You have the right to access, correct, or delete the Personal Information that we collect. You are also entitled to restrict or object, at any time, to the further processing of your Personal Information. You have the right to receive your Personal Information in a structured and standard format. You may lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority regarding the processing of your Personal Information. To protect the privacy and the security of your Personal Information, we may request information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access such information, as well as to search for and provide you with the Personal Information we maintain. There are instances where applicable laws or regulatory requirements allow us to refuse to provide or delete some or all of the Personal Information that we maintain. In this case, we reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, because it is repetitive) and/or to charge a fee that takes into account the administrative costs for providing the information or taking the action requested.
				</p>
				<p>
					In your request, please make clear what information you would like to access or have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database, or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also use Anonymous Information, such as web or mobile pages you have viewed, in order to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may improve our products and services, enhance our user experience, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Anonymous Information consists of data that would not identify you personally; these records exclude information (such as your name) that makes them personally identifiable to you. We may disclose Anonymous Information to third parties that promote our products and services. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Information Sharing
				</h2>
				<p>
					Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties and we will not disclose financial information that is part of your Personal Information unless you request or authorize that we do so. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may disclose Personal Information to its corporate subsidiaries or affiliated entities. Any Personal Information provided to our subsidiaries or affiliated entities will be treated by those subsidiaries and affiliated entities in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may share your Personal Information with third parties, such as RALLY initiators ("Initiators"), to provide you with the products and services that we offer you through the Website. We make no representations or warranties as to how such Initiators will use your Personal Information. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service providers (for example, without limitation, individuals providing support services to us, targeted advertising through social media, etc.) for the sole purpose of providing products and services to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may participate in co-branding or co-promotional agreements with third parties pursuant to which we may share Personal Information with such third parties ("Partners"). For example, we may participate in agreements with Partners pursuant to which we provide the Partners with a URL and a customer registration page co-branded with or privately labeled by the Partners, and the Partners distribute and promote the URL to its customers. A Partner may have access to Personal Information that we collect from their customers. As a result, if you register on the Website through a Partner, we may provide your Personal Information to the Partner. We do not control the privacy practices of these Partners.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may offer you the chance to participate in drawings, contests, giveaways, and promotions ("Special Promotions") through our Web site. By registering for a Special Promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that Special Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Special Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Special Promotion. If you choose to enter a drawing, contest, or other promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Special Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Special Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use your Personal Information in order to provide to third parties non-personal aggregated information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted and that is combined with the Personal Information of other users ("Aggregate Information"). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our site and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might also inform a company that performs services or that provides products and/or services to us (that may or may not be a business partner or an advertiser on our site) that "50% of our users live in the USA" or that "85% of our users have purchased products and/or services which can be downloaded from our Website." Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We may not limit the third parties' use of the Aggregate Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information we have collected and that company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the following scenarios, we may be required to share your Personal Information:
					<ul>
						<li>
							If we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving possible threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law.
						</li>
						<li>
							If we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or if we need to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
						</li>
						<li>
							If we believe it is necessary to restrict or inhibit any user from using any of our Websites, including, without limitation, by means of "hacking" or defacing any portion thereof.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>
					Opt-Out
				</h2>
				<p>
					You have options regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may specify a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the chance to opt-out. Despite your selected preferences, we may send you communications regarding the services we provide to you, such as notices about administrative updates, transaction reports, notices of new Website releases, and notices regarding changes to the Website, updates to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, or other policies. You may make changes to any of the Personal Information in your account.
				</p>

				<h2>
					California Privacy Rights
				</h2>
				<p>
					As provided by California Civil Code 1798.83, if you are a California resident, you have the right to receive (a) information identifying any third party company(ies) to whom we have disclosed your Personal Information to in the past year; and (b) a description of the categories of Personal Information disclosed.

				<h2>
					Cookies and Similar Technologies
				</h2>
				<p>
					We may use pixel tags, cookies, and/or other similar technologies, sometimes from third parties, to collect visitor information. Cookies, for example, are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. They make it possible for us to save the items in your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, recognize your browser when you visit, and provide you with information about products that interest you. By doing this, we can customize your return visits and save you time during checkout. It is possible to deactivate cookies from being used in your browser by turning the feature off, but in order to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user, your browser must be set to accept cookies.

				<!-- <h2>
					Security
				</h2>
				<p>
					Your account is password protected for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password, and limiting access to your computer, phone and browser by taking precautions such as signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We use industry standard measures to protect Personal Information. However, we cannot guarantee the security of account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
